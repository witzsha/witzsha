Public chat off, feel free to interact in whispers.<br>
If theres "no response" in my nick - i wont respond. It's not personal, Im just tired, busy or not in the mood to talk. This does not apply to my close friends.<br>
Feel free to c+h. As long as you're not covering me I dont have a problem with that.

Im an artist, bone collector and a professional vanderbell shipper. Really into rdr2 now, but my other interests include: Don't Starve Together, Batman Arkham, Gotham and Transformers. If youre into any of that I'd be more than happy to interact with you.<br>
Please keep in mind that I am mentally ill and seriously paranoid. Because of that I tend to isolate and im not really talkative unless I get to know you better.

People under the age of 15, countryhumans fandom and overall weirdos please do not interact.<br>
Do not talk to me if you're friends with [Ollie](https://github.com/ihopemyabsencehauntsyou) (aka ihopemyabsencehauntsyou), ESPECIALLY if you know about the things he has done. By ignoring that, youre showing him and people his kind that his actions don't have consequences. You're encouraging this type of behaviour and giving people like him a silent agreement to continue doing whatever they want to. This makes you a part of a problem.<br>
If you dont know whats my problem with Ollie, or you dont know who he is at all, please check out this [site](https://ollie59845958.straw.page/).
